                    <p>  "Expression Lighting" is a premium feature on many modern pinball machines, or a high-end and expensive mod for older machines. But if you are only looking to increase the brightness on your game, it can be done much cheaper.
                        LED strip prices have dropped dramatically, and a basic portable kit can be done yourself for less than $50 in parts.</p>
                    <p>See this pinside thread for more elaborate instructions, build examples, and active discussion: <a href="https://pinside.com/pinball/forum/topic/poor-mans-stadium-lighting">Poor Man's Stadium Lighting</a>, but the TL:DR; is
                        to attach cheap LED strips to extruded channel and power them with a USB power bank or 12V power supply. You will have to do some wirework to connect the strips to the power source.
